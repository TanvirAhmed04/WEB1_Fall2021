                        <p>
                            Murgh makhani, anglicised as butter chicken, is a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato and butter sauce. It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste. You can have it with rice or Indian flat breads like naan, kulcha, chapati, roti, etc. If you don't have anything, just place it atop a piece of store-bought bread and enjoy! Butter chicken tastes joyously delicious in all and every form.

                        The Jaguar C-X75 is a hybrid-electric, 2-seat, concept car produced by British automobile manufacturer Jaguar Cars in partnership with the derivative of the Formula One team, Williams Advanced Engineering which debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. I like this car because it's a little different from all of their other designs and they were very creating with its details. It expresses the speed of a jaguar.
