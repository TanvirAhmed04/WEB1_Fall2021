      Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their new duties and support each other on and off the battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the human world.

I would recommend picking this show back up or start it if you are newly watching this show. The storyline of this show is very amazingly written with very many arcs. The arcs are awesome and interesting to watch because there is always a cliffhanger on every arc which makes it even more fun to watch. I also love this show because of how well-written the main protagonist is. Almost all kinds of themes are added into this show which gives you different emotions every time you watch a different episode. The protagonist and the side characters are also from a different backstory. They are given very important roles to play in the main character's life. I especially recommend watching the show because of the power development. The show has very few filler arcs, and with each arc, the main character gets an amazing-looking form with a new powerup.
